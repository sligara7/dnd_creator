I'll analyze the backend API to provide you with a comprehensive list of features you can test through the frontend. Let me examine the API endpoints in app.py first. Now let me check what features are available in the generators and character creation modules: Let me create a comprehensive frontend testing guide based on the API endpoints and features I've found: 

Made changes.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Frontend Testing Features Summary**

I've created a comprehensive testing guide! Here are the **34 API endpoints** you can test through your frontend:

### **ðŸ”¥ Core Features to Test:**

#### **1. Essential Character Operations (6 endpoints)**
- Create, read, update, delete characters
- Get complete character sheets with all stats
- List and filter multiple characters

#### **2. Real-time Gameplay (5 endpoints)**  
- Live HP/condition tracking
- Combat damage/healing system
- Short/long rest mechanics
- Real-time state synchronization

#### **3. AI-Powered Generation (8 endpoints)**
- Backstory generation with LLM integration
- Equipment suggestions based on character level
- Quick generation: characters, items, NPCs, creatures
- Full content creation with detailed stats

#### **4. Advanced Character Versioning (13 endpoints)**
- **Git-like system** for character development
- Timeline visualization and progression tracking
- Character branches for alternate development paths
- Commit system with snapshots and history
- Automated level-up with auto-commits
- Milestone tagging system

#### **5. Validation & Quality (2 endpoints)**
- Character rule validation
- D&D 5e compliance checking

### **ðŸŽ® Must-Test Scenarios:**

1. **Character Creation Flow** â†’ Generate backstory â†’ Equipment suggestions
2. **Combat Session** â†’ Damage tracking â†’ Healing â†’ Rest system  
3. **AI Content Generation** â†’ Items, NPCs, Creatures with LLM
4. **Version Control** â†’ Character evolution â†’ Branching â†’ Timeline viz
5. **Validation** â†’ Rule compliance â†’ Error handling

### **ðŸ“Š Interactive Documentation:**
When your backend is running, visit `/docs` for **Swagger UI** with:
- Live API testing interface
- Request/response schemas  
- Interactive parameter testing

The backend provides a **complete D&D ecosystem** with AI integration, real-time gameplay, and advanced character versioning - perfect for testing a full-featured frontend!

It seems like calculate_all_derived_stats() is used to calculate HP and other derived stats after setting up the character. For basic character creation, we might be able to skip it initially. Let me check what the current character creation flow looks like and see if we can make it work without this method.
