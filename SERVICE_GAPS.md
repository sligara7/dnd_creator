## Overview
This document serves as a high-level index of remaining work needed for each service. Detailed completion tasks and progress tracking are maintained in service-specific COMPLETION_TASKS.md files.

Process Reminders:

Pre-Task:
- Review service's SRD (System Requirements Document) and ICD (Interface Control Document) to ensure requirements and interfaces are considered in context. See the index at: /dnd_char_creator/DOC_INDEX.md
- Index the files within a service to know exactly what the service already performs

Post-Task:

   b. Update this SERVICE_GAPS.md:
      - Mark completed items with ✓
      - Add completion date in parentheses
      - Update status sections if needed
   
   c. If major changes were made:
      - Update the service's README.md with new capabilities
      - Update WARP.md if architectural changes affect the system

2. Git Updates (REQUIRED):
   a. Stage changes:

      git commit -m "[Service Name] Brief description of changes
      
      - Detailed bullet point of major change 1
      - Detailed bullet point of major change 2
      - References task/issue number if applicable"
      ```
   
   c. Push to remote:
      ```bash
      git push origin main  # or appropriate branch
      ```

3. Testing Updates:
   - Run existing tests: `poetry run pytest`
   - Add new tests for added functionality in appropriate test files
   - Verify all tests pass

Major Changes & Milestones:
- For significant functionality changes or milestone completions:
  * Update the service's README.md with new capabilities or architectural changes
