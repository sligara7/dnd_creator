Post-Task:
- Update the service's COMPLETION_TASKS.md with task completion details
- Reflect high-level progress in this SERVICE_GAPS.md
- Update GitHub (commit and push) with the completion

Major Changes & Milestones:
- For significant functionality changes or milestone completions:
  * Update the service's README.md with new capabilities or architectural changes
  * Update /dnd_char_creator/WARP.md to reflect system-level changes or milestone achievements
  * Examples of major changes:
    - New core features or capabilities
    - Architectural changes affecting other services
    - Performance or security improvements
