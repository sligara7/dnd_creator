# Service Architecture Gap Analysis

## Overview
This document serves as a high-level index of remaining work needed for each service. Detailed completion tasks and progress tracking are maintained in service-specific COMPLETION_TASKS.md files.

Process Reminders:

Pre-Task:
- Review service's SRD (System Requirements Document) and ICD (Interface Control Document) to ensure requirements and interfaces are considered in context. See the index at: /home/ajs7/dnd_tools/dnd_char_creator/RQMTS.json
- Review architectural rules.  See the rules at: /home/ajs7/dnd_tools/dnd_char_creator/ARCHITECTURE.json
- Index the files within a service to know exactly what the service already performs
- Use poetry 2.0 and pyproject.toml approach versus using requirements.txt for creating environment
- IMPORTANT - Minimalist Implementation Philosophy:
  * Implement only the absolute minimum set of functions required to meet the SRD and ICD requirements
  * Resist feature creep and over-engineering - if a feature isn't explicitly required, don't build it
  * Even if a service has evolved into a complex implementation, evaluate stripping it back to core functions
  * Focus on simple, efficient solutions that can be enhanced later rather than building everything upfront
  * The goal is a lean, maintainable codebase that does exactly what's needed - nothing more, nothing less

Post-Task:

AFTER completing ANY task, perform these steps IN ORDER:

1. Documentation Updates:
   a. Update the service's COMPLETION_TASKS.md:
      - Add completion timestamp
      - Document key changes made
      - Note any technical details worth preserving
   
   b. Update this SERVICE_GAPS.md:
      - Mark completed items with ✓
      - Add completion date in parentheses
      - Update status sections if needed
   
   c. If major changes were made:
      - Update the service's README.md with new capabilities
      - Update WARP.md if architectural changes affect the system

2. Git Updates (REQUIRED):
   a. Stage changes:
      ```bash
      git add .
      ```
   
   b. Create detailed commit:
      ```bash
      git commit -m "[Service Name] Brief description of changes
      
      - Detailed bullet point of major change 1
      - Detailed bullet point of major change 2
      - References task/issue number if applicable"
      ```
   
   c. Push to remote:
      ```bash
      git push origin main  # or appropriate branch
      ```

3. Testing Updates:
   - Run existing tests: `poetry run pytest`
   - Add new tests for added functionality in appropriate test files
   - Verify all tests pass

Major Changes & Milestones:
- For significant functionality changes or milestone completions:
  * Update the service's README.md with new capabilities or architectural changes
