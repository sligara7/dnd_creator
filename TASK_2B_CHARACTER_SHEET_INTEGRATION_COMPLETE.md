# Task 2B: Character Sheet Integration - COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully updated character sheet endpoints to display allocated spells/items via UUID rather than hardcoded data. The character sheet now integrates with the unified catalog system to show both traditional and custom content.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `load_character_sheet` Method
**File:** `/backend/src/models/database_models.py`
- Modified to return a full `CharacterSheet` object instead of just `CharacterCore`
- Integrated `UnifiedCatalogService` to load allocated items from the database
- Added error handling to gracefully fall back if catalog loading fails
- Maintains all existing character data loading functionality

### 2. Enhanced CharacterState Model
**File:** `/backend/src/models/character_models.py`
- Added new fields to `CharacterState.__init__()`:
  - `allocated_spells`: Dict with "spells_known" and "spells_prepared" arrays
  - `allocated_equipment`: Dict with "inventory" and "equipped" arrays
  - `all_allocated_items`: Comprehensive list of all allocated items
- Updated `CharacterState.to_dict()` to include these new fields in serialization
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing equipment fields

### 3. Fixed Unified Catalog API Dependencies
**File:** `/backend/src/api/unified_catalog_api.py`
- Updated `get_catalog_service()` dependency to use proper session injection
- Changed from creating `CharacterDB()` object to using `Depends(get_db)`
- Fixed session management issues in all catalog endpoints

### 4. Created Comprehensive Test Suite
**File:** `/backend/test_character_sheet_integration.py`
- Complete integration test verifying the end-to-end workflow:
  - Character creation
  - Spell allocation via unified catalog
  - Equipment allocation via unified catalog
  - Character sheet retrieval with allocated items
  - Backward compatibility verification

## Features Implemented

### UUID-Based Item Integration
- Character sheets now include allocated items referenced by UUID
- Each allocated item includes both the access record and full item details
- Supports multiple access types: spells_known, spells_prepared, inventory, equipped

### Comprehensive Item Details
Each allocated item in the character sheet includes:
- **Access Record**: character_id, item_id, access_type, quantity, acquired_at, acquired_method
- **Item Details**: UUID, name, type, subtype, content_data, spell_level, class_restrictions, etc.
- **Full Traceability**: When/how the item was acquired, custom properties, notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Original equipment fields remain in place and functional
- Existing API clients continue to work without modification
- Traditional hardcoded equipment coexists with UUID-based allocations

### Error Resilience
- Character sheet loading gracefully handles catalog service failures
- Fallback behavior ensures sheets load even if allocation data is unavailable
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

## API Response Structure

Character sheets now include this enhanced structure:

```json
{
  "core": { ... },
  "state": {
    // Traditional equipment (backward compatibility)
    "equipment": {
      "armor": null,
      "shield": false,
      "weapons": [],
      "items": [],
      "magical_items": [],
      "attuned": []
    },
    
    // NEW: UUID-based allocated items
    "allocated_spells": {
      "spells_known": [
        {
          "id": "access-uuid",
          "character_id": "char-uuid",
          "item_id": "spell-uuid",
          "access_type": "spells_known",
          "acquired_at": "2025-07-03T23:01:05.042875",
          "acquired_method": "Starting spell 1",
          "item_details": {
            "id": "spell-uuid",
            "name": "Acid Splash",
            "item_type": "spell",
            "spell_level": 0,
            "spell_school": "Evocation",
            "content_data": { ... }
          }
        }
      ],
      "spells_prepared": []
    },
    
    "allocated_equipment": {
      "inventory": [ ... ],
      "equipped": [ ... ]
    },
    
    "all_allocated_items": [ ... ]
  },
  "stats": { ... }
}
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Character Creation**: Successfully creates characters via `/api/v2/characters`
✅ **Spell Allocation**: Successfully allocates spells via `/api/v2/catalog/access`
✅ **Equipment Allocation**: Successfully allocates equipment via `/api/v2/catalog/access`
✅ **Character Sheet Retrieval**: Enhanced sheets include all allocated items with full details
✅ **UUID Integration**: All items properly referenced and displayed via UUID system
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Original equipment fields preserved and functional
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback behavior when catalog services fail

## Next Steps

Task 2B is complete. The character sheet now fully integrates with the unified catalog system. Ready to proceed with:

- **Task 2C**: Implement class/proficiency validation on allocation
- **Task 2D**: Implement spell swapping system for spellcasters  
- **Task 2E**: Implement equipment swapping system
- **Task 2F**: Ensure LLM-generated content integration

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/src/models/database_models.py` - Enhanced `load_character_sheet()`
2. `/backend/src/models/character_models.py` - Updated `CharacterState` model
3. `/backend/src/api/unified_catalog_api.py` - Fixed dependency injection
4. `/backend/test_character_sheet_integration.py` - Comprehensive test suite

## Dependencies Working

- ✅ Unified catalog system operational
- ✅ Character-item access tracking functional
- ✅ Database session management fixed
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Migration script populated catalog with 387 official items
