creation.py missing:
I'll help you completely refactor the creation.py script for campaign creation. Let me first examine the current requirements and reference files to understand the scope. Now let me check the key API endpoints that need to be created by looking at more of the requirements: Let me also check the existing app.py to understand the current API structure: Now I'll create a comprehensive refactoring plan. Based on the requirements and reference files, I'll break this into discrete tasks:

## Refactoring Plan: Campaign Creation Service

### Task 1: Core Infrastructure and Base Models
- Set up the base campaign creator architecture
- Define core enums and constants for campaign types
- Create the foundational BaseCreator class

### Task 2: Campaign Generation Endpoints
- Implement campaign creation from scratch
- Implement campaign skeleton generation
- Add campaign refinement and evolution

### Task 3: Chapter Management System
- Create chapter generation endpoints
- Implement chapter content creation
- Add chapter dependency management

### Task 4: Character Integration Layer
- Integrate with backend character service
- Implement automatic NPC/monster generation
- Add genre/theme consistency validation

### Task 5: Advanced Features
- Plot fork system implementation
- Psychological experiment integration
- Setting theme system
