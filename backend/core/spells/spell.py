# # get_spell_details(spell_name) - Get detailed information about a spell
# # get_class_spell_list(class_name, level) - Get spells available to a class at a level
# # calculate_spell_save_dc(ability_score, proficiency_bonus) - Calculate spell save DC

# Customizing Spell System with Llama 3/Ollama Integration
# Each function in spell.py can be enhanced through LLM interactions to provide a personalized spellcasting experience:

# 1. get_all_spells()
# LLM Enhancement: "Based on your character's personality, which is {personality_traits}, suggest spells that would resonate with their nature"
# Implementation: Add parameter filtered_by_character_concept=False to optionally return LLM-recommended spells matching character concept
# Prompt Example: "You are a {class_name} who values {values}. Recommend 5 thematically appropriate spells."
# 2. get_spell_details(spell_name)
# LLM Enhancement: "Provide creative examples of how {spell_name} could be used beyond its obvious applications"
# Implementation: Add parameter include_creative_uses=False to augment standard details with LLM suggestions
# Prompt Example: "How might Fireball be used for something other than damage in a creative scenario?"
# 3. get_class_spell_list(class_name, level)
# LLM Enhancement: "Based on my character's background as {background} and focus on {playstyle}, which spells would be most useful?"
# Implementation: Add parameters character_background and playstyle for personalized recommendations
# Prompt Example: "I'm playing a Wizard who was formerly a sailor and focuses on controlling the battlefield. What spells align with this concept?"
# 4. calculate_spell_save_dc(ability_score, proficiency_bonus)
# LLM Enhancement: "Explain the tactical implications of my spell save DC being {dc}"
# Implementation: Add explain_implications=False to provide tactical context on the calculated DC
# Prompt Example: "My spell save DC is 15. What does this mean for my effectiveness against different types of enemies?"
# 5. calculate_spell_attack_bonus(ability_score, proficiency_bonus)
# LLM Enhancement: "Compare the advantages of spell attacks vs. saving throw spells with my current modifiers"
# Implementation: Add compare_to_saves=False to provide strategic comparisons
# Prompt Example: "With a +7 spell attack bonus and DC 15 saves, when should I prefer attack roll spells vs. save spells?"
# 6. get_prepared_spells_limit(class_name, level, ability_score)
# LLM Enhancement: "Given that I can prepare {limit} spells, suggest an optimal balance for my next adventure in {environment}"
# Implementation: Add parameters adventure_context and suggest_loadout=False
# Prompt Example: "I can prepare 8 spells as a level 5 Druid. We're traveling through mountains to face a dragon. What's a good spell selection?"
# Implementation Approach
# Create an LLMSpellAdvisor class that handles all Ollama/Llama3 interactions
# Each method can optionally call this advisor when customization is requested
# Cache LLM responses for common questions to improve performance
# Allow DMs to override or approve LLM suggestions to maintain game balance
# This approach allows the core spell system to function with standard rules while offering creative, personalized enhancements through AI assistance when desired.

# have method to create some suggested spells (use LLM) based on the character concept
