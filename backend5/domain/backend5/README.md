# D&D Character Creator - Domain Layer

## Overview

The Domain Layer of the D&D Character Creator is designed to encapsulate the core business logic and rules governing the creation and validation of D&D content. It adheres to Domain-Driven Design principles, ensuring a rich domain model that accurately reflects the complexities of the D&D universe.

## Directory Structure

The Domain Layer is organized into several key components:

- **Exceptions**: Custom exceptions for handling domain-specific errors.
- **Entities**: Core business entities representing various D&D concepts such as characters, spells, and equipment.
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects that represent descriptive aspects of the domain, such as ability scores and tags.
- **Services**: Domain services that encapsulate business logic and operations that span multiple entities.
- **Specifications**: Encapsulated business rules and validation logic.
- **Events**: Domain events that facilitate communication between different parts of the system.
- **Repositories**: Interfaces for data access, allowing for separation of concerns between the domain and data storage.
- **Factories**: Classes responsible for creating complex domain objects.

## Key Components

### Exceptions
- **Base Exceptions**: General exceptions for the domain.
