"""
Creative Culture Generation Type Definitions - Character Generation Focused.

Defines creative-friendly type system for AI-powered culture generation with
character creation focus, constructive enhancement suggestions, and creative
freedom enablement over academic restrictions.

Follows CREATIVE_VALIDATION_APPROACH philosophy:
- Enable creativity rather than restrict it
- Focus on character generation support and enhancement
- Constructive suggestions over rigid requirements
- Almost all cultures are usable for character generation

This module provides:
- Character-focused culture generation types
- Creative-friendly authenticity levels
- Enhancement suggestion categories (not blocking validation)
- Gaming utility optimization enums
- Creative workflow status tracking
