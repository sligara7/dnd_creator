Creative Culture Generation - Character Generation Focused.

Transforms culture specifications into character-ready culture data with creative freedom.
Follows Clean Architecture principles and CREATIVE_VALIDATION_APPROACH philosophy:
- Enable creativity rather than restrict it
- Focus on character generation support and enhancement
- Constructive suggestions over rigid requirements
- Almost all cultures are usable for character generation

This module provides:
- Creative-friendly culture template creation
- Character generation focused validation
- Flexible culture data structure manipulation
- Pure functional approach optimized for gaming utility
- Enhancement suggestions rather than restrictive validation
