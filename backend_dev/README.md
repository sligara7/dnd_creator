#### Required GitHub Secrets

Set up these secrets in your repository:
1. Go to your repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Click "New repository secret" and add:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key (starts with `-...`)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Anthropic API key (optional)  
- `DB_PASSWORD` - PostgreSQL database password
- `SECRET_KEY` - Application secret key

### Local Development Setup

1. **Run the setup script**
   ```bash
   ./setup-dev.sh
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Edit .env file with your API keys
   nano .env
   ```

3. **Test the setup**
   ```bash
   python test_llm_diagnostic.py
   ```
