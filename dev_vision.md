# D&D Character Creator Backend - Engineering Requirements

## CORE MISSION
Create an AI-powered D&D 5e 2024 character creation system that enables users to bring ANY character concept to life through:
- **Creative Freedom**: Generate non-traditional characters beyond standard D&D constraints
- **Custom Content Creation**: Automatically create new classes, species, feats, spells, weapons, and armor
- **Deep Storytelling**: Generate compelling backstories aligned with character concepts
- **Iterative Development**: Collaborative character refinement through user feedback
