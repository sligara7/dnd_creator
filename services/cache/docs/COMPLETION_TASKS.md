## Progress Notes

### 2025-09-07
Completed core cache service implementation:
- Created comprehensive Redis client with cluster, sentinel, and standalone support
- Implemented multi-level caching with local TTL cache and distributed Redis
- Added circuit breaker for fault tolerance
- Created cache manager to orchestrate all operations
- Implemented all REST API endpoints per ICD specification
- Added Prometheus metrics and monitoring
- Implemented compression, serialization, and connection pooling
- Added key validation and service-based keyspace isolation
- Configured health checks and statistics collection

Key features implemented:
- Full CRUD operations (get, set, delete)
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Pattern matching with scan
- Cache flush with service/pattern filtering
- Statistics and metrics collection
- Multi-level cache hierarchy (local + distributed)
- Automatic failover and circuit breaking
- Compression for large values
- Service-based access control
