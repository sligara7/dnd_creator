## Test Implementation Guidelines

### Test Organization
- Tests should be organized by feature area
- Each test class should focus on a specific functionality
- Test names should clearly indicate what is being tested
- Use appropriate test markers (unit, integration, e2e)

### Test Dependencies
- Use test fixtures for common setup
- Mock external service dependencies
- Use test databases with transactions
- Clean up test data after each test

### Test Coverage Requirements
1. All Independent Variables: 100% coverage
2. All Derived Variables: 100% coverage
3. State Management: 95% coverage
4. API Endpoints: 90% coverage
5. Event Handling: 90% coverage

### Test Data
```python
@pytest.fixture
def test_character_data():
    return {
        "name": "Test Character",
        "species": "Human",
        "class": "Fighter",
        "level": 1,
        "ability_scores": {
            "strength": 15,
            "dexterity": 14,
            "constitution": 13,
            "intelligence": 12,
            "wisdom": 10,
            "charisma": 8
        }
    }
```

### Database Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def event_loop():
    """Create an instance of the default event loop for each test case."""
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop_policy().new_event_loop()
    yield loop
    loop.close()

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
async def db_manager():
    """Create a test database session manager."""
    manager = TestSessionManager(TEST_DATABASE_URL)
    await manager.init()
    
    # Create all tables
    async with manager.engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.create_all)
    
    yield manager
    
    # Drop all tables after tests
    async with manager.engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.drop_all)
    
    await manager.close()

@pytest.fixture
async def db_session(db_manager) -> AsyncSession:
    """Create a new database session for a test."""
    async with db_manager as session:
        yield session
```

### Event Mocking
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_message_hub():
    with patch("character_service.external.message_hub.MessageHub") as mock:
        yield mock
```

## Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all character service tests
poetry run pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test categories
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_character_sheet.py -v
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_theme_management.py -v
poetry run pytest tests/integration/test_events.py -v

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Pre-Test Requirements
1. Test database setup with migrations
2. Mock Message Hub configured
3. Test environment variables set
4. Required test data seeded

### Post-Test Cleanup
1. Test database cleanup
2. Remove temporary test files
3. Reset mocked services
4. Clear any test cache
