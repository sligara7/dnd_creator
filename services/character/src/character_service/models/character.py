"""ARCHIVED - DO NOT USE

This module has been archived and should not be used. The Character model has been moved to
character_service.models.models and redesigned to use a JSONB-based approach for storing
character data.

See migration aeb085e011f4_update_character_model.py for details about the schema changes.

A backup of this file can be found at models/archive/character.py.bak
