Last Updated: 2025-09-20

## Overview

The Game Session Service is a critical component that coordinates live D&D gameplay sessions, managing real-time state synchronization between players and orchestrating interactions between various services during gameplay. The service acts as a real-time orchestrator, ensuring seamless gameplay experiences by coordinating state changes, combat actions, and cross-service communication.

## Core Requirements

### Live Gameplay Coordination
- Must provide real-time session management for active D&D gameplay sessions
- Must support multiple concurrent game sessions with isolated state management
- Must enforce game rules and state transitions during live play
- Must coordinate turn order and action resolution during combat
- Must handle player connection/disconnection gracefully with state preservation

### Real-time State Management
- Must maintain consistent game state across all connected clients
- Must use Redis for ephemeral session state and WebSocket session management
- Must persist critical state changes to session_db via storage service
- Must handle race conditions and concurrent state modifications
- Must provide state rollback capabilities for error recovery
- Must maintain session history for audit and recovery purposes

### Combat Coordination
- Must manage combat initiative tracking and turn order
- Must coordinate action resolution between participants
- Must handle status effects and condition tracking
- Must manage battlefield positioning and movement
- Must coordinate attack rolls, saving throws, and damage resolution
- Must handle concentration checks and spell effects
- Must manage temporary combat effects and their durations

### WebSocket Communication
- Must implement secure WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Must handle WebSocket session authentication and authorization
- Must implement heartbeat mechanism for connection health monitoring
- Must gracefully handle client reconnection scenarios
- Must implement proper connection cleanup on session end
- Must scale horizontally with Redis-backed session management

### Service Orchestration
- Must coordinate with Character Service for character state updates
- Must interact with Campaign Service for session and story progression
- Must integrate with LLM Service for dynamic content generation
- Must use Image Service for map and tactical display updates
- Must leverage Cache Service for performance optimization
- All service communication must be routed through Message Hub

## Performance Requirements

### Response Times
- Real-time updates: < 100ms end-to-end latency
- Combat actions: < 200ms resolution time
- State synchronization: < 50ms between state change and client notification
- WebSocket connection establishment: < 1s
- Service orchestration calls: < 500ms round-trip

### Scalability
- Must support minimum 100 concurrent active game sessions
- Must handle minimum 10 players per game session
- Must process minimum 100 state updates per second per session
- Must maintain performance metrics for all operations

### Reliability
- Service uptime: 99.9%
- WebSocket connection stability: 99.9%
- State consistency: 100% across all connected clients
- No data loss during normal operations or graceful shutdowns

## Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- Must validate all WebSocket connections through Auth Service
- Must enforce role-based access control for game actions
- Must validate all player actions against character permissions
- Must prevent cross-session state access or manipulation

### Data Protection
- Must encrypt all WebSocket communications
- Must sanitize all real-time data exchanges
- Must implement rate limiting for player actions
- Must prevent replay attacks on action submissions

## Technical Requirements

### Required Dependencies
- aio-pika: For Message Hub integration
- websockets: For WebSocket server implementation
- redis: For session state and WebSocket session management

### Storage Requirements
- Must use session_db in storage service for persistent data
- Must implement efficient state serialization
- Must maintain audit logs for all significant actions

## Integration Requirements

### Message Hub Integration
- Must publish state change events
- Must subscribe to relevant service events
- Must implement proper error handling and retries
- Must maintain event ordering guarantees

### Storage Service Integration
- Must use session_db for persistent state storage
- Must implement efficient bulk operations
- Must maintain proper transaction boundaries

### Redis Integration
- Must implement proper key namespacing
- Must handle Redis cluster scenarios
- Must implement proper error handling and fallbacks

## Monitoring Requirements

### Health Checks
- Must implement both liveness and readiness probes
- Must track WebSocket connection health
- Must monitor Redis connection status
- Must verify Message Hub connectivity

### Metrics
- Must track all performance metrics
- Must monitor error rates and types
- Must measure service orchestration latencies
- Must record WebSocket connection statistics

## Documentation Requirements

### API Documentation
- Must provide complete WebSocket event documentation
- Must document all REST endpoints
- Must include example payloads and responses
- Must maintain up-to-date OpenAPI specifications

### Operational Documentation
- Must provide deployment guides
- Must document scaling considerations
- Must include troubleshooting procedures
- Must maintain runbooks for common scenarios
