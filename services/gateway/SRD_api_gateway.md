# System Requirements Document: API Gateway Service (SRD-GW-001)

Version: 1.0
Status: Active
Last Updated: 2025-08-30

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The API Gateway Service acts as the unified entry point for all client requests, providing authentication, routing, rate limiting, and monitoring capabilities for the D&D Character Creator system.

### 1.2 Core Principles
- Single public entry point for the entire system
- All inter-service communication MUST go through Message Hub
- No direct service-to-service communication allowed
- Service isolation and independence
- Event-driven architecture

### 1.3 Scope
- Request routing and load balancing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- Monitoring and analytics
- Security and encryption
- Service discovery
- Health checking

### 1.3 Out of Scope
- Business logic processing
- Data storage (beyond caching)
- User management
- Service-to-service communication
- Content generation
