# Service Implementation Gaps

## Campaign Service Integration

### Missing Features
1. Event-Driven Updates
   - Need to implement event bus integration
   - Add handlers for campaign state changes
   - Set up notification system for chapter updates

2. Data Synchronization
   - Implement real-time sync with campaign service
   - Add conflict resolution logic
   - Set up data consistency validation

3. State Management
   - Add session state tracking
   - Implement world state influence
   - Create character state integration

## Content Generation

### System Limitations
1. Theme Processing
   - Limited theme analysis capabilities
   - Basic theme blending only
   - No theme evolution tracking

2. Narrative Generation
   - Simple story structure generation
   - Limited character arc integration
   - Basic world state influence

3. Content Validation
   - Basic rules validation
   - Limited balance checking
   - Simple theme consistency checks

### Technical Debt
1. Service Integration
   - Direct service calls instead of message bus
   - Synchronous operations blocking flow
   - Limited error recovery strategies

2. Testing Coverage
   - Missing integration tests for some paths
   - Limited performance testing
   - No chaos testing implemented

3. Monitoring
   - Basic health checks only
   - Limited metrics collection
   - No distributed tracing

## Security Concerns

1. Authentication
   - Basic API key authentication
   - Limited role-based access
   - No fine-grained permissions

2. Data Protection
   - Simple encryption at rest
   - Basic transport security
   - Limited audit logging

## Performance Considerations

1. Scalability
   - Single instance deployment
   - No load balancing
   - Limited caching implementation

2. Resource Usage
   - High memory usage during generation
   - Long-running synchronous operations
   - Inefficient data processing

## Operational Gaps

1. Deployment
   - Manual deployment process
   - No blue-green deployment
   - Limited rollback capabilities

2. Monitoring
   - Basic logging only
   - No alerting system
   - Limited debugging tools

## Next Steps

Priority improvements needed:
1. Implement event-driven architecture
2. Enhance theme processing
3. Add comprehensive testing
4. Implement proper monitoring
5. Set up security controls
