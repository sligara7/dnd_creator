## Progress Notes

### 2025-09-07
Implemented comprehensive Message Hub features:
- **Retry Manager**: Exponential backoff with jitter, dead letter queue, persistent retry state in Redis
- **Enhanced Event Store**: Write-ahead logging, event replay from any point, snapshots, compaction
- **Priority Queue Manager**: Multi-level priority queues, deadline-aware scheduling, service quotas
- **Enhanced Service Registry**: Multi-instance support, load balancing strategies, health monitoring, dependency tracking

Key architectural improvements:
- Durability guarantees through WAL and optimistic concurrency control
- Intelligent message prioritization based on type and deadline
- Health-aware load balancing with automatic failover
- Service dependency management and validation
