## Progress Notes

### 2025-09-07
Implemented comprehensive Message Hub features:
- **Retry Manager**: Exponential backoff with jitter, dead letter queue, persistent retry state in Redis
- **Enhanced Event Store**: Write-ahead logging, event replay from any point, snapshots, compaction
- **Priority Queue Manager**: Multi-level priority queues, deadline-aware scheduling, service quotas
- **Enhanced Service Registry**: Multi-instance support, load balancing strategies, health monitoring, dependency tracking

Key architectural improvements:
- Durability guarantees through WAL and optimistic concurrency control
- Intelligent message prioritization based on type and deadline
- Health-aware load balancing with automatic failover
- Service dependency management and validation

### 2025-09-07 (Service Completion)
Fully completed Message Hub service implementation:
- **API Integration**: Integrated all advanced components into main app.py
- **New Endpoints**: Added comprehensive REST API endpoints for all features
- **Configuration**: Updated settings with all component parameters
- **Integration Tests**: Created full system integration test suite
- **Documentation**: Updated all documentation to reflect completion

Service Status: FEATURE COMPLETE
- All core functionality implemented and tested
- Production-ready configuration
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Ready for deployment and cross-service integration
