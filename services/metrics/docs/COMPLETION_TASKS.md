# Metrics Service - Completion Tasks

## Progress Log

### 2025-09-20 Storage Service Integration
Implemented storage integration via Message Hub:

1. Message Client Implementation:
   * Created MessageClient class for Message Hub communication

   * Added proper timestamps and soft delete support
   * Implemented model validation with Pydantic

3. Message Protocol:
   * Defined message types for storage operations
   * Created structured message headers
   * Implemented proper correlation ID tracking
   * Added error handling and responses

4. Router Integration:
   * Updated alert endpoints to use Message Hub
   * Updated dashboard endpoints to use Message Hub
   * Added proper dependency injection
   * Created comprehensive test suite

Next Steps:
1. Complete Message Hub event handling
2. Implement metric collection endpoints
3. Add alert evaluation system
4. Create dashboard visualization support

### 2025-09-20 Core Metrics Infrastructure
Completed core metrics system implementation:

1. Registry System:
   * Created MetricsRegistry class for centralized metric management
   * Implemented support for Counter, Gauge, and Histogram metrics
   * Added metric definition and metadata handling
   * Created safe cleanup and unregistration system

2. HTTP Metrics:
   * Added MetricsMiddleware for automatic HTTP metrics collection
   * Implemented standard HTTP metrics:
     - Request duration histograms
     - Request count tracking
     - Active request monitoring
   * Added path and method-based labeling
   * Excluded /metrics endpoint from collection

3. Testing Infrastructure:
   * Created comprehensive test suite
   * Added metric registry fixtures
   * Implemented middleware tests
   * Added metrics validation tests

4. Prometheus Integration:
   * Mounted Prometheus ASGI app for metrics exposure
   * Configured standard service metrics
   * Added proper metric naming and labeling

Next Steps:
1. Setup storage service integration
2. Implement alert management system
3. Create dashboard functionality
4. Add Message Hub integration

### 2025-09-20 Project Structure Setup
Completed initial project structure implementation:

1. Poetry Configuration:
   * Created pyproject.toml with required dependencies:
     - aio-pika for Message Hub integration
     - prometheus-client for metrics
     - FastAPI and dependencies
   * Added development dependencies:
     - pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov
     - black, isort, ruff, mypy
   * Configured tool settings for consistent development

2. FastAPI Application Structure:
   * Created main.py with FastAPI app setup
   * Implemented configuration management with Pydantic
   * Setup router structure for modular endpoints:
     - Metrics router
     - Alerts router
     - Dashboards router
     - Health check router
   * Added service configuration with environment variable support

3. Docker Configuration:
   * Created multi-stage Dockerfile:
     - Builder stage for Poetry dependencies
     - Final stage with production setup
     - Security considerations (non-root user)
   * Setup docker-compose.yml with:
     - Environment configuration
     - Health checks
     - Volume for Prometheus data
     - Network configuration

4. Development Environment:
   * Created test configuration with pytest
   * Added test client fixture
   * Setup development scripts:
     - run_dev.sh for local development
     - run_tests.sh for test execution
   * Configured code formatting and linting tools

5. Initial API Setup:
   * Health check endpoint with service status
   * Basic router structure for core endpoints
   * Pydantic models for request/response validation
   * Prometheus metrics endpoint mounting
