## In Progress Tasks

### API Endpoints
- Asset management endpoints (placeholder created, needs implementation)
- Version management endpoints (placeholder created, needs implementation)
- Policy management endpoints (placeholder created, needs implementation)
- Backup management endpoints (placeholder created, needs implementation)

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority

#### Backup Service
- [ ] Create BackupService with scheduling
- [ ] Implement full backup functionality
- [ ] Add incremental backup support
- [ ] Create restore functionality
- [ ] Add backup verification

#### Backup System
- [ ] Create BackupService with scheduling
- [ ] Implement full backup functionality
- [ ] Add incremental backup support
- [ ] Create restore functionality
- [ ] Add backup verification

#### Message Hub Integration
- [ ] Create MessageHubClient
- [ ] Implement event publishing:
  - asset.created
  - asset.updated
  - asset.deleted
  - version.created
  - backup.completed
- [ ] Add event subscription handlers
- [ ] Implement retry and error handling

### Medium Priority

#### API Implementation
- [ ] Complete asset CRUD endpoints
- [ ] Add batch upload endpoints
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Add filtering and pagination
- [ ] Create admin endpoints

#### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add Redis caching layer
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add request/response compression
- [ ] Create CDN integration
- [ ] Optimize database queries

#### Monitoring & Metrics
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics:
  - Storage utilization
  - Operation latency
  - Upload/download throughput
  - Error rates
  - Cache hit rates
- [ ] Create dashboards
- [ ] Add alerting rules

### Low Priority

#### Documentation
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger specs
- [ ] Write integration guides
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add performance tuning guide

#### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for services
- [ ] Integration tests for S3
- [ ] API endpoint tests
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Backup/restore testing

#### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Add encryption at rest
- [ ] Implement access control lists
- [ ] Add audit logging
- [ ] Create security scanning
- [ ] Implement rate limiting

## Technical Debt

1. Complete API endpoint implementations (currently placeholders)
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Implement request validation
4. Add transaction management
5. Create service interfaces for testing

## Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Using MinIO for local development, S3 for production
- Async throughout for better performance
- Soft delete pattern for data recovery
- UUID primary keys for all entities
- Event-driven architecture via Message Hub

### Configuration
- Service runs on port 8005 by default
- PostgreSQL database: storage_db
- S3/MinIO endpoint configurable via environment
- Redis caching ready but not yet implemented

### Dependencies
- Requires PostgreSQL 13+
- Requires MinIO or S3-compatible storage
- Redis recommended for caching
- Message Hub service for events

## Next Steps

1. Implement core asset management service
2. Complete API endpoints for basic operations
3. Add Message Hub integration
4. Create comprehensive test suite
5. Add monitoring and metrics

## Performance Targets

Per SRD requirements:
- Upload speed: 50MB/s+
- Download speed: 100MB/s+
- API latency: < 100ms
- High availability: 99.99%
- Concurrent operations: 1000+
